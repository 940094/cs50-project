The premise behind this project is that if people plan their meals, they save time.
And time not spend preparing food (or better yet, money not spent) can be put to better use.

Enter "Recipe Finding App," which assits the user with finding and saving recipes based on ingredients and prep time.
These happened to be the two most important factors amongst the people I surveyed.

The web app has the functionaility to register, log in, search using prep time + keywords, save a favorite, and delete a saved recipe.

The web app is built using python, jinja, flash, and SQL.

The web app is dependent on a few of the above mentioned and their libraries.
Also, dependent on the Traitify API, which I discovered on GitHub: https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api,

Happy Coding + Eating!! :)
